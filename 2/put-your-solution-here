The complexity of the code snippet above can be calculated by multiplying the notations 
for each line. Because there are nested repetitions, the operation used is addition. 
This means that the result of the nested repetition is: O(n) * O(n) = O(n2). 
So for the two commands above the result is O(1) + O(1) = O(2).When combined the result 
is O(n2) O(2). However, usually for the type of code above, it is sufficiently denoted 
by O(n2) _ O(2)
